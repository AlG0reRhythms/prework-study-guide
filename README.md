# <UW Coding Bootcamp Prework Website>

## Description

- My motivation for this webpage was to create a webspace in which I could jot down and explain concepts pertaining to HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
- I built this page to not only better understand the most fundamental components of full-stack development, but apply them in real time
- This website helps new bootcamp students with understanding the foundations of full-stack development
- I learned how to construct a basic webpage utilizing HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
