# <UW Coding Bootcamp Prework Website>

## Description

- My motivation for this webpage was to create a webspace in which I could jot down and explain concepts pertaining to HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
- I built this page to not only better understand the most fundamental components of full-stack development, but apply them in real time
- This website helps new bootcamp students with understanding the foundations of full-stack development
- I learned how to construct a basic webpage utilizing HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript
