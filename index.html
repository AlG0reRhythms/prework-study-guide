        <ul>
          <li>CSS imparts style to your webpage using <em>declarations</em></li>
          <li>any line of CSS code consist of a selector and a declaration</li>
          <li>a selector defintes the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations will apply
          <ul><li>"div" is a common selector placeholder
            <li>however, you can use any HTML element as a selector to apply rules to them</li>
          </ul></li>
          </li>
          <li>declarations consist of 2 important components
          </li>
            <ul><li>The CSS property we want to apply (e.g. color)</li>
              <li>the value of said property</li>
              <li>e.g. div {color: blue; text align: justify;}</li>

          <li>The <em>box method</em> describes the relation of objects in your webpage</li>
          <ul><li><img id="inTextFigures" src="/assets/assets/BoxModel.png" alt="a picture of the box model"></li></ul>
          <li>There are multiple different selectors we can choose to exercise rules to different elements
          </li>
          <li>Examples of HTML elements you can make rules for:</li>
          <ul>Examples of HTML elements you can make rules for: 
            <li>*: applies a given rule to all the elements on your HTML page</li>
            <li>header: applies rules to the header</li>
            <li>footer: applies rules to the footer</li>
            <li>hx: where x = 1-6 to apply rules to headers</li>
            <li>p: applies a set of rules across all paragraphs in the file</li>
            <ul></ul>
          </ul>
          <li>In order to save time and not repeat yoself, you can apply the same rules to different selectors by simply separating them with a comma</li>
          <li>Additionally, you can assign classes to HTML elements by adding "class=x" in their tag </li>

          <li><em>git init</em>: initiates an empty repo, use this when you first enter a directory to create a .git file</li>
          <li><em>git status</em>: see what is set for staging and what working files need to be updated/added/removed</li>
          <li><em>git add &lt;filename&gt;</em>: add a file to staging</li>
          <li><em>git add -u</em>: updates all the files needed in staging (quick hand so as to not add files separately)</li>
          <li><em>git commit -m &lt;commit message here&gt;</em>: make the commit message as descriptive as possible; takes a snapshot of the repo if you were to push the branch this is what you would be "pushing"</li>
          <li><em>git push</em>: pushes what file you're on to the repo</li>
          <li><em>git branch -b &lt;newBranchName&gt;</em>: creates a new branch</li>
          <li><em>git checkout&lt;branchName&gt;</em>: takes you to a certain branch
          <li><em>git pull</em>: pull down changes from repo, comes in handy when you work with others</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Javascript makes a website interactive</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store values in our code.</li>
            <ul><li>e.g. <em>let band = Creeping Death"</em></li>
            <li>For the above example, console.log(band) will display "Creeping Death" in your browser console</li></ul>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script, it always runs linearly, from top to bottom</li>
            <ul><li>Because of control flow, the link to JS within an html file should always be inserted at the bottom of the body</li></ul>
          <li><strong>conditional statements</strong> and <strong> loops</strong> control the order in which code is executed</li>
          <li><strong>if statements</strong> are a type of conditional statement that will execute a code if the statment meets a specific condition</li>
          <ul> <li><em>if(condition) {}</em></li>
            <li>you can set up more than one condition by using <em>else if (second condition) {}</em> </li>
          </ul>
          <li>An <strong>array</strong> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
          <ul><li><em>let bands = ["Creeping Death", "200 Stab Wounds", "Undeath"];</em></li>
          <li>arrays are indexed at zero, meaning in the above, Creeping Death would have a value of 0</li></ul>
          <li><strong>for loops</strong> harness the index order, making it possible to perform a task on all the items in an array</li>
          <ul><li>for loops contain 3 important statements</li>
            <ol><li>the <strong>starting point</strong> of our loop <em>let x = 0</em></li>
            <li>the <strong>condition</strong> which allows the loop to execute code once per item in the array; <em>x < bands.length;</em></li>
            <li>the <strong>final statement</strong> which allows the array to iterate over each individual item; <em>x++</em></li></ol>
          <li>e.g.: let(bands x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
            // code block
           }</li></ul>
           <li>a <strong>function</strong>: is a set of instructions that informs the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
           <ul><li>Unlike for loops, they are not automatically executed, and instead have to be called by name</li>
            <li>to create a function, use first use the <em>function</em> keyword to declare a new variable and give our functin a unique name followed by ()</li>
           <li>follow this line with {}, which will contain the code you want to execute</li>
           <li>in order to call a function, simply type out the appropriate function name with ()</li>
